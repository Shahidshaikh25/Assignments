        "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to facilitate the design, organization, and maintenance of complex software systems by modeling real-world entities and their interactions using objects and classes. OOP promotes the concept of encapsulation, where data and the methods that operate on that data are encapsulated within a single unit, the object. This enhances code reusability, modularity, and separation of concerns. Inheritance allows for the creation of hierarchies of related classes, enabling the reuse and extension of code. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, fostering flexibility and extensibility in software design. Overall, OOP aims to improve software development efficiency, code organization, and the ability to manage complex systems."

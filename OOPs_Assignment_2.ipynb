This enables the subclass to reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass, promoting code reusability and modularity. Inheritance is used to establish an \"is-a\" relationship between classes, where the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass. This simplifies code maintenance, reduces redundancy, and facilitates the creation of hierarchies of related classes, promoting efficient and organized software development."
